Mingyuan Xue, 2024 iMeta, “Deciphering functional groups of rumen microbiome and their underlying potentially causal relationships in shaping host traits”. 

Figure 1 contains the features of metaproteome and metatranscriptome.

Figure 2 contains the data on alpha diversity and differential proteins of the volcano plot.

Figure 3 contains the functional groups of metabolites, proteins, and mRNA.

Figure 4 contains the data of MTB, MTP, MTT functional groups.

Figure 5 contains the data of proteins involved in critical metabolic pathways in the rumen microbial functional groups based on the metaproteome.

Figure 6 contains the proteins involved in the metabolic pathways in which Selenomonas bovis participates in the rumen function of high feed-efficient dairy cows and their causal relationships with key functions.

The R code file contains the code for PCA, volcano plot, PERMANOVA, TwoSampleMR, fit, and median analysis.
